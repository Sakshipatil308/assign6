      In London, 1871, troubled by a strange recurring dream and mourning the
      loss of her father, 19-year-old Alice Kingsleigh attends a garden party at
      the estate of Lord Ascot. There, she is confronted with an unwanted
      marriage proposal by Lord Ascot's son, Hamish, and the stifling
      expectations of the society in which she lives. Unsure of how to proceed,
      she spots and pursues a familiar rabbit wearing a waistcoat and carrying a
      pocket watch, and falls into a deep rabbit hole under a tree. She enters a
      small door by drinking from a bottle labeled 'Drink Me' (called
      Pishsalver) and emerges to a forest in a magical place called Underland
      where she is greeted by the White Rabbit, a Dormouse, a Dodo, Talking
      Flowers, and identical twins Tweedledee and Tweedledum who all apparently
      know her. Though Alice asserts that this is all a dream, she learns that
      she is destined to slay the Jabberwocky and end the tyranny of the Red
      Queen, as foretold by Absolem the Caterpillar. The group is then ambushed
      by the ravenous Bandersnatch and a squadron of Red Queen’s knights, led by
      the Knave of Hearts. All are captured; except Alice, who escapes; and the
      Dormouse, who takes one of the Bandersnatch’s eyes. The Knave informs the
      Red Queen that Alice threatens her reign, and he is ordered to find her
      immediately. Meanwhile, Alice is greeted by the Cheshire Cat who guides
      her to the Mad Hatter, the March Hare and the Dormouse's tea party. The
      Hatter explains that the Red Queen took over Underland, usurping her
      sister the White Queen; and that he joined the resistance after she
      destroyed his village and killed his family. When the red knights appear,
      the Hatter helps Alice to avoid capture by allowing himself to be seized
      instead. Later, Alice is found by the Knave’s Bloodhound who is actually
      allied with the resistance. Alice insists on being taken to the Red
      Queen’s castle to rescue the hatter. Alice eats Upelkuchen (a cake labeled
      'Eat Me') and grows tall, infiltrating the castle as a courtier named
      “Um.” Alice learns that the vorpal sword, the only weapon capable of
      killing the Jabberwocky, is locked inside the Bandersnatch’s den. The
      Knave attempts to seduce “Um”, but she rebuffs him, causing the jealous
      Red Queen to demand for “Um’s” beheading. Alice obtains the sword and
      befriends the Bandersnatch by returning its eye. She then escapes on the
      back of the grateful Bandersnatch and delivers the sword to the White
      Queen; who gives Alice a potion that returns her normal size. The Cheshire
      Cat uses his shapeshifting powers to save the Mad Hatter from execution.
      The Hatter then incites rebellion amongst the Red Queen’s subjects. The
      Red Queen attempts to quell the rebellion, but the Hatter and his group
      escape. Absolem finally gets Alice to remember that she has been to
      Underland when she was a little girl (calling it “Wonderland”), and she
      finally realizes that Underland is not a dream. Absolem advises her to
      fight the Jabberwocky, just before completing his transformation into a
      pupa. The Queens gather their armies on a chessboard-like battlefield and
      send Alice and the Jabberwocky to decide the battle in single combat.
      Alice fights the Jabberwocky, as the two armies battle. Alice finally
      defeats the Jabberwocky by beheading it. At Alice’s victory, the red
      knights turn against their ruler. As punishment for their crimes, the
      White Queen banishes her sister and the Knave into exile together. The
      White Queen gives Alice a vial of the Jabberwocky's purple blood whose
      power will bring her whatever she wishes. She decides to return to her own
      world after saying farewell to her friends. Back at the party, Alice
      refuses Hamish's proposal and impresses Lord Ascot with her idea of
      establishing oceanic trade routes to Hong Kong, inspiring him to take her
      as his apprentice. As Alice prepares to set off on a trading ship, a blue
      butterfly lands on Alice’s shoulder, which she recognizes as Absolem.
